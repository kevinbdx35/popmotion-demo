# Popmotion Demo

A draggable ball animation demo from Frontend Masters, using the [Popmotion](https://popmotion.io/) library. Drag the ball and release — it springs back to the center.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Popmotion v8 (via unpkg CDN)

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` directly in a browser — no build step required.

## Notes

> This demo uses Popmotion v8.1.24 (pinned via CDN). The current Popmotion API (v11+) is significantly different. The code works as-is with the pinned version.

## Improvements

- Added `<meta charset="UTF-8">` and `<meta name="viewport">` to `index.html`
